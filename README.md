# work-day-scheduler
Work Day Scheduler powered by JQuery

## Description

The aim of this project was to create an online scheduler to keep track of workday appointments using Moment.JS. This calendar gave me the opportunity to work with third party APIs and integrate that knowledge into my javascript foundation. This project also allowed me insight into the potential lack of documentation when working with third party APIs, as I found the [Moment.JS](https://momentjs.com) guides to be slightly lacking. Furthermore, I learned to be more careful when naming my variables and elements, as using both full words and abbreviations can cause confusion when scripting and create bugs.

## Features

This page features:

- Local storage
- Continuous time tracking



<!-- If your project has a lot of features, list them here. -->

<!-- ## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. -->

## Tests

Enter your appointment, click the save button, and refresh your screen to see the local storage functionality.

Click the "Clear Calendar" button to clear the local storage.

Open the calendar at different times to keep track of the current time in relation to the calendar.


<!-- Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here. -->
